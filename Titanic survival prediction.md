Titanic survival prediction is a project which is intended to detect the number of passengers survived the crash and number of passenger died in the crash.
The dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns. 
The dataset provides us the 
1. passengerid,
2. survived, 
3. Pclass, 
4. Name, 
5. Sex, 
6. Parch, 
7. Cabin, 
8. Fare, 
9. Ticket, 
10. Embarked,
11. age,
12. Sibsp.

The dataset was processed using the following libraries
1. pandas, 
2. numpy, 
3. matplotlib,  
4. seaborn 
and the dataset manipulated using pandas and numpy.
Where the plots were obtained by using matplotlib and seaborn
The following plots were described by bar chart, histogram, pie chart by using matplotlib and countplot form seaborn. Later after manipulating the data we used various type of machine learning techniques to predict the death toll in the great titanic crash.
We have used Naives bayes model, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machines and K-nearest negihbour and obtained the best results for Naives bayes algorithm
